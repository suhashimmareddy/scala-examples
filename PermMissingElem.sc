  /*
  A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

  Your goal is to find that missing element.

  Write a function:

  object Solution { def solution(A: Array[Int]): Int }

  that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

    For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
  the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

  Assume that:

    N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
  the elements of A are all distinct;
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
  Complexity:

    expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
  expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
  Elements of input arrays can be modified.
